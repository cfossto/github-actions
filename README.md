# github-actions
Showcase for Github actions. Setting up a fictional flow for a Java Spring project.

Two very basic Github actions are set up for a fictional Java Spring project.
One is just building and testing the fictional application.
The second one is building, testing, building a Docker container and pushing it to
a remote repository.

Connected to local Jenkins instance for testing.
